# Article of the Day (AOTD)

I built this app so I could discuss relevant events, articles, and topics of interest with my friends. We regularly did this inside an email chain, and I wanted to abstract it to a more formal, accessible, and easy to use platform. I was inspired by [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and designed/built the app with this simplicity and effectiveness in mind.
